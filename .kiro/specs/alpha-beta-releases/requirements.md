# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing GitHub Actions workflow for the Boomberman add-on to support automated alpha and beta releases in addition to the current production releases. The workflow currently builds Docker images and creates releases for version tags, but lacks support for pre-release channels that would allow testing of development and release candidate versions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically create GitHub alpha releases when pushing to dev branches, so that I can distribute development versions for testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a push occurs to a branch starting with "dev" THEN the system SHALL create a GitHub release with "prerelease" flag set to true
2. WHEN creating an alpha release THEN the system SHALL tag the release with "alpha" suffix
3. WHEN creating an alpha release THEN the system SHALL include changelog since last release in the release notes
4. WHEN creating an alpha release THEN the system SHALL use the branch name as part of the release identifier

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically create GitHub beta releases when pushing to release branches, so that I can distribute release candidates for final testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a push occurs to a branch starting with "release" THEN the system SHALL create a GitHub release with "prerelease" flag set to true
2. WHEN creating a beta release THEN the system SHALL tag the release with "beta" suffix
3. WHEN creating a beta release THEN the system SHALL include changelog since last release in the release notes
4. WHEN creating a beta release THEN the system SHALL use the branch name as part of the release identifier

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the release workflow to handle different branch types consistently, so that the CI/CD process is predictable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining release type THEN the system SHALL differentiate between dev branches (alpha), release branches (beta), and version tags (production)
2. WHEN creating any pre-release THEN the system SHALL ensure it doesn't interfere with production release creation
3. WHEN generating release names THEN the system SHALL use a consistent naming convention for each release type
4. WHEN multiple releases are created THEN the system SHALL maintain proper chronological ordering

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily identify different release types in GitHub, so that I can choose the appropriate version for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing releases in GitHub THEN alpha releases SHALL be clearly marked as pre-releases
2. WHEN viewing releases in GitHub THEN beta releases SHALL be clearly marked as pre-releases
3. WHEN viewing releases in GitHub THEN production releases SHALL be marked as latest releases
4. WHEN viewing release names THEN the release type SHALL be clearly indicated in the title

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure enhanced bot detection and GeoIP features through the Home Assistant add-on interface, so that I can customize security settings without editing configuration files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the add-on THEN the system SHALL provide options for bot detection thresholds and weights
2. WHEN configuring the add-on THEN the system SHALL provide options for geographic analysis settings
3. WHEN configuring the add-on THEN the system SHALL provide options for behavioral analysis parameters
4. WHEN configuring the add-on THEN the system SHALL provide options for whitelist configuration
5. WHEN updating configuration THEN the system SHALL validate that detection weights sum to 1.0
6. WHEN updating configuration THEN the system SHALL validate threshold values are within 0-100 range

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the add-on to support the new environment variables for enhanced functionality, so that I can leverage improved bot detection and logging capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the add-on starts THEN the system SHALL support all new environment variables from the enhanced configuration
2. WHEN using GeoIP features THEN the system SHALL properly configure database paths
3. WHEN using enhanced bot detection THEN the system SHALL apply configured weights and thresholds
4. WHEN using log retention THEN the system SHALL respect the configured retention period
